                                    Environmental safety for Personal Computing Clusters (PCC) is crucial for both operational efficiency and sustainability. Proper temperature control through efficient cooling systems prevents overheating and hardware damage. Power management with Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) protects against outages and surges, while secure grounding avoids electrical hazards. Fire safety measures, such as gas-based suppression systems, minimize risks without harming equipment. Responsible e-waste disposal and the use of energy-efficient hardware contribute to environmental sustainability. Finally, physical security measures, including restricted access and secure racks, ensure a safe and organized workspace.
